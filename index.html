                    <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a social program enacted by American government in the 1960s to combat hunger in the United States; it is more commonly known as food stamps, referring to the way that the aid was disbursed with special coupons before the switch to an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system. In this visualization, we'll explore a brief history of the program as well as examine how the program benefits states individually. </p>

Below, we present a collection of general statistics relating to SNAP's usage and funding. On the left, we have data related to the cost of the program, the average benefit it has provided over time, and a comparison of the two. On the right, we have a comparison of SNAP (which makes up the bulk of Food and Heatlh Assistance, shown in red) to other Public Assistance line items that make up the welfare state of the United States.

                <p>Compared to other programs like Social Security and Medical Assitance, the line item of Food and Nutrition Assistance (in bright red) has grown relatively little over time. Even now, it represents less than 4% of total expenditures on public assistance programs. Its return on investment is also spectacular: for every 1 dollar spent on SNAP, 1.70 dollars are added to the economy, representing a growth of 70%.

                <div class='summary-content'>
                    <p> Though SNAP was initiated at the Federal Level, the States each choose to implement their own versions of SNAP, with different application requirements and income cutoffs. Along with inherent demographic variations, this has led to a large amount of variation among the 50 states in terms of who is benefitting from the program and how much. For example, the average benefits in Hawaii and Alaksa are much higher than those in much of rest of the United States.

                <p>Under federal law, there are three criteria that every household must meet in order to qualify for

                <ul>
                    <li>Household gross monthly income must be at most 130% of the federal poverty line unless the household includes
                    an elderly or disabled member.</li>
                    <li>Household net monthly income after deductions must be at or below the federal poverty line</li>

                </ul>
                <p>These limitations, however, can be adjusted to some degree by the state implementing the food stamp

                    <li>Whether all of the household changes will be acted upon or not</li>

                    <p> Recently, the Trump administration created new work requirements for those who receive food snaps as beneficiaries of the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program.
                        The new rules remove some of the states' flexibility of waiving certain working requirements for individuals to
                        qualify for food stamps to match their states' needs.
                        As a result of these new requirements, nearly 700,000 Americans will no longer have access to a basic need.</p>
